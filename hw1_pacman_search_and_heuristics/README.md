An introductory assignment to Artificial inteligence, search and heuristics. 
This assignment is Berkley's (CS 188 | Spring 2019) 1st AI project [https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp19/project1.html]
You can execute my solution by downloading the project's source code and replacing "search.py" and "searchAgents.py" with my own versions
Design and Implementation details can be found both in the source comments and in the provided pdfs
